Title: Multi-Segment Executable File Template for Encryption Using LFSRs

Description:
This project provides a multi-segment executable file template written in assembly language for implementing encryption using Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs). It demonstrates a basic encryption algorithm that utilizes LFSRs to generate a keystream for encrypting user-provided messages.

Key Features:
- Modular structure with distinct segments for data, stack, and code.
- Implements LFSRs for generating pseudorandom keystreams.
- Supports encryption of user-provided messages.
- Includes procedures for clocking LFSRs, performing irregular clocks, and generating the keystream.
- Provides printing functions to display the LFSR registers and generated keystream.

Usage:
1. Users can input a message to be encrypted at runtime.
2. The program utilizes LFSRs and the provided session key to generate a keystream.
3. The generated keystream is used to encrypt the input message.
4. The encrypted message (ciphertext) is displayed as output.
5. The LFSR registers and generated keystream can also be printed for debugging purposes.

This project serves as a starting point for implementing encryption algorithms using LFSRs and can be customized and extended as per specific requirements. Developers can leverage the provided template and build upon it to create more robust encryption solutions.

Note: It is important to review and modify the code according to security best practices before using it in production environments.
